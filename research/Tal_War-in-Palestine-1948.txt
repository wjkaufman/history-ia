Introduction:

_____

Israel, Arab powers have fought consistently for large part of history (didn’t just begin in 1948)

Important documents in G.B., Israel, and U.S.
Arab records aren’t open (idk why)
	doesn’t mean Arabs were unanimous in decisions, we just can’t see behind the scenes
War involved 5 armies: Israel, Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese

War of 1948 was far more traditional war, infantry was most powerful weapon, very little technology (few planes, tanks, etc.)
	very little formal training of officers, some were from G.B. not not many, not acknowledged for superior military knowledge

Arab side was not much better.  G.B. had established military schools, but most of the Arab armies were poor

book looks more at military/diplomacy history, rather than political/social (4 bottom)

Jewish state was more organized than Arab Palestinians, less local/regional approach to fighting

issues with Jews defending settlements (big part of Zionist ethos) that were widely dispersed, needed to concentrate power to fight effectively
