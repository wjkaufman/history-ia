Introduction:

_____

Jewish National Movement and Arab National Movement occurred simultaneously

Zionism: began in latter half of 1880’s
	Palestine: part of Ottoman Empire
	Ottoman Empire: didn’t like Zionism, saw it as European (Russian, Jews from Russia) threat in Ottoman
	native Palestinians didn’t like incoming Jews, hostile towards them (2)

1893: Tahir al-Husayni (mufti of Jerusalem, leaders of Muslim community in Palestine) led campaign against Jewish settlement/immigration
	saw Jewish immigrants as threats to Palestinian community

Jewish purchasing of land threatened Palestinians, forwarded Zionist movement
	competitions between land, work/employment, etc.

1930’s: growing immigration to Palestine (rise of Nazism, fascism) led to increased tensions, even more competition, led to increased fears for Palestinians
	led to Arab Revolt of 1936-9

1918: Palestine to control of Britain (post WWI)
	big change from 400 yrs Ottoman rule, 1000 yrs of Muslim rule
	Sykes-Picot Agreement: between G.B. and France, split up Middle East territories, decided G.B. gets Palestine
	Balfour Declaration: signed 2 Nov 1917, contained vague establishment of Jewish home in Palestine (4)
	22nd clause of League of Nations covenant entrusted Britain with eventually forming independent states in Middle East

Difficulties between France, G.B. for deciding borders.  Esp. on North, East side
	water resources, economic considerations played role

G.B. had made deal with Sharif Husayn (Hashemite family) for family to have control over Arab areas (against French agreements)

Lots of messy local conflicts between Arab people, G.B. tried to make Hashemite family happy, but seemed to be manipulating people poorly (6)

Abdullah (Hashemite family) went over to claim Transjordan, set limits on Zionist settlement
	some Zionists saw Transjordan as part of biblical Palestine, but didn’t affect majority too much
		difference in geographical boundary created rift in Zionist policy
	Transjordan separated from Palestine in September 1922 

G.B. was stuck, had to create independent Arab states, but also said (in Balfour) that they’d help the Jews with their Zionism
	Jews = 1/10 population in 1922

wave of Jewish immigration in 1926 (Polish pogroms) set off tensions
	G.B.: Palestine may be more burden than strategic asset
		G.B. tried to solve the conflict multiple times, proposed schemes
		Arab Palestinians rejected schemes, believed pro-Arab G.B. Foreign Office would eventually repudiate (refuse) Balfour Declaration
		Palestinian Jews accepted most schemes, bc schemes included recognition of Jewish state

with onset of Nazism, fascism in Europe, Arabs couldn’t argue for “position” on Jews in Palestine.  ∃ immediate need to save the Jews
	Jews grew to 1/3 of population, still used Balfour Declaration to justify their own state
	Arab Revolt in 1936-9

Arab Revolt ended in White Paper of 1939 (not liked by Jews)
	promised repudiation of Balfour, severe restrictions on Jewish immigration
	Jewish organizations set up illegal immigration, settlement plans

G.B.: Ernest Bevin: foreign secretary of G.B., had to determine British policy in Palestine
	Acted similarly to last government, wanted to appease the Arabs, limited Jewish immigration and land purchasing.  Proposed plans, but now rejected by both Arabs AND Zionists (10)

August 31 1945: Harry Truman pressured G.B. to allow 100,000 Jews from Europe to Palestine	Bevin responded by calling for Anglo-American committee
	Bevin wanted to involve U.S. more to reach solution in Palestine

Anglo-American committee initiated diplomatic struggle between Palestinians, Zionists
	United Nations now existed, worked to come up with solutions

Committee toured displaced persons camp in Europe first
	most Jews convinced to take Zionist stance for “united Jewish front”
	Holocaust facts beginning to emerge, evoked sympathy towards Jews

Committee then went to Palestine
	welcomed by Jews, boycotted by Arab Higher Committee (idk why), moved committee more to Jewish side
	U.S. supported Zionism, Truman was especially sympathetic (needed to be popular in his own right (non-elected president) and most supported Jewish state in Palestine)

Committee concluded 30 April 1946.  Recommended immigration of 100,000 Jews from Europe, also recommended establishment of binational state under U.N. that offered equal rights to both communities
	committee failed to make any changes

new committee established, G.B.’s Herbert Morrison, U.S.’s Henry F. Grady were reps
	Morrison-Grady Committee recommended division of Palestine into 4 provinces 

Bevin allowed 100,000 immigrants, but over period of 2 years

Bevin proposed cantonization of Palestine
	cantonization: division of territory
	Zionists: steadfast for partition
	Arabs: steadfast for complete independence (without Jewish state)

G.B.: lots of problems domestically and internationally, couldn’t/didn’t want to solve the Palestine problem
	G.B. treated Palestine similarly to India, evacuation and transfer of power
	complete motivation debated, right-wing Israelis believe underground organizations pressured G.B. into leaving

British mandate ended, question of rule/power handed to U.N.

1: UN Discussion (p16)

_____

Palestine conflict was first major challenge for U.N. (entrusted to UN in February 1947)
UN followed similar path as Britain, set up commission to investigate, needed to represent US, USSR (two big superpowers), and Britain (ex mandate power) fairly 
established UNSCOP: UN special committee on Palestine (members from Sweden, US, Australia, Canada, Holland (British), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, India, Iran (Asia, Muslim), Uruguay, Guatemala (Holy See)
	result of US design to keep USSR out of determining future of Palestine
	most supported US stance (religious, political interests) (p18)
	most of the members were chosen not for knowledge of region but for representation of others’ interests

28 April 1947: UN invited spokesmen to NY to present opposing POV’s
	Abba Hillel Silver: head of Jewish Agency’s office in NY
	Henry Cattan: lawyer from Jerusalem, member of Arab Higher Committee
	Hillel emphasized importance of world Jewry, home for Jewish population
	Cattan: injustices suffered by Arabs (Balfour decl. on)

14 May 1947: Andrei Gromyko (Russia, deputy foreign minister) supported partition as suitable solution for Palestine
	partition considered to be pro-Zionist (included Jewish state)
	surprising to other powers, thought to be seeking power in future settlements (p19)
	also thought to be move to expel GB from Middle East

Russian agreement/cooperation with UN on Palestine helped Jewish diplomats make favorable resolution for Jews (not good for Palestinians)
	thus UNSCOP had predisposed consensus on Palestine


Palestine: territory torn by violence/war: mostly Jews vs. mandatory authorities from “illegal” immigration
	violence between Arabs and jews subsided after Arab Revolts of 1939
	Jewish underground movements: National Military Organization (“Irgun”, “the organization”, “IZL”
		aspired for Jewish control over Palestine and Transjordan
	Hagana: main military underground
	LEHI: other group, acronym for “Israel Freedom Fighters”, aka “Stern Gang” after Abraham Stern

GB: worked to enforce immigration acts to keep law and order (so they thought); wanted US to allow more immigration to ease influx to Palestine
	US didn’t actually help ease immigration to Palestine, even with plea from PM Attlee

Immigration was huge problem, issue considered by UNSCOP

only 5 weeks of the 5 months for committee were spent in Palestine, most discussions in Europe or US
	recommendation of solution accepted by General Assembly, rejected by Arabs (in a way led to war) (p22)
	both Jews, Arabs felt that UNSCOP wasn’t authority in conflict and needed to be listened to, but rather place for world public opinion

UNSCOP’s choices limited by horrors of Holocaust, behavior of Palestinians in meetings
	Arab Higher Committee: “led by Nazi collaborator” -Jorge Gracia-Granados (talking about Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husayni (did collaborate with Hitler))
	AHC felt UNSCOP was helpless cause, didn’t receive them well, didn’t cooperate, refused to testify, protest/strike instead of reception
	AHC thought it knew what the decision from UNSCOP would be, but didn’t think to try and settle something
		because AHC, Palestinian authorities didn’t try to settle, necessity of Jewish state (Holocaust, morality) triumphed
			Palestinians could’ve agreed, but to a small Jewish state, rather than rejecting it outright

UNSCOP impressed by Jewish Agency cooperation and pragmatism, appeared to be willing to compromise (p24)

Exodus: Jewish refugee ship from France to Palestine in 1947, coincided with UNSCOP’s visit in Palestine
	outcome: committee decided to accept link of European Jewry to Palestine

Irgun also hanged 2 British sergeants the same week as Exodus in retaliation for British punishment in retaliation for British officer club bombing (killed 12)
	hurt Jewish argument, but didn’t hurt too much (UN saw British as villains, not Jews)

Palestinians couldn’t present coherent, unified stance vs. Jewish stance
	Palestinian cause argued for by Political Committee of Arab League (consisted of most of Arab heads of states)
		because of this, Palestinians only played small limited role in conflict, despite being the main group affected (p26)

reps from Arab countries (Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen) met with UNSCOP in Lebanese Foreign Office 22 July 1947
	didn’t find any members (-Indian) pro-Arab
	Arabs totally refused Jewish representation, further immigration, creation of independent Arab state
	primary concern for Arab reps was inter-Arab rivalries
	Transjordan King Abdullah wasn’t present in meeting, wanted to address Palestinian question alone (weakened Arab position)

US limited immigration for Jews, so Palestine was only reasonable option

by end of committee UNSCOP (August/September 1947), most members were convinced of pro-Zionism and antagonist nature of Palestinians (p28)

points of UNSCOP: remove British mandate, “internationalize” the territory, esp. Jerusalem (make Jerusalem an international city with equal rights for all)

going to stop reading and annotating here (p29 1/2 way down) and just read.  Will make notes when necessary, but I think it would be more efficient and useful to just read.

Also, it seems like my thesis isn’t coming up anytime soon.

_____

30_bottom: UNSCOP territorial data may have been just from the previous committee recommendation (data from 1937)
34-36: GB was not supportive of majority opinion of UNSCOP largely because of Arab ties (wanted to make everyone happy, ultimately made no one happy)
36: US was pro-Zionist (White House was, State Dept. wasn’t, but Truman imposed his will)
41: reconciliation between two positions was impossible (said UN committee).  25 Nov 1947: final draft of partition resolution: Resolution 181.
	Resolution 181 direct cause of 1948 war
43: 29 November 1947 General Assembly in NY voted in favor of partition, accepted resolution
	Arabs, Arab League declared war against implementation of resolution, most then thought implementation would be impossible without Russian help (but they couldn’t bc of Cold War and spheres of influence)
UN Resolution consequences: happy Jews, still sober Jewish leaders, little change in Arab community (not close to Jewish unification/determination)
45: footnote 100:* (relates to thesis) some argue that Jews accepted UN resolution as move to continue expanding, making territorial claims in the future
45-6: interesting take*: Jewish state was not at risk of annihilation, but was actually in pretty good position to dominate (so the war was pseudo-defensive, but more like Arabs didn’t want to/couldn’t (not sure yet) wipe out Israel
