Given my former research from Ilan Pappe's book, I'm going to skim and find pertinent parts, then parhaps go back and read if I have more time

_____

63: UN Partition Resolution vote: 33 votes yes, 13 no, 10 abstentsions
65: 37% of population in Palestine (Jewish) got 55% of land in UN partition (and Jews only owned 7% at that point)
72_bottom: British mandate would end mid May 1948, Arabs planned to invade then to prevent implementation of UN partition
77: war called different things.  Arabs: First Palestine War, Palestinians: "the disaster," Jews: War of Independence/Establishment/Liberation
Civil War from 30 November 1947 (directly after UN Partition) to 14 May 1948 (right before GB Mandate ends)
Palestinians supported by volunteer groups from Arab world
2 parts to Civil War: Nov-March (Palestinians on offensive, Hagana on defense, no clear fronts), April - May (Hagana offensive (with Plan D), crushed Palestinians, created clear fronts)
Civil War took place while GB mandate was still there, but British offensive diminished as May approached (reason why Plan D happened at that point?*)
81: GB, people initially thought Palestinians would win civil war
	outmatched Jewish population 2:1 (1.2 million to 630,000 Jews)
	held more land, held highlands
	had sympathetic nations surrounding them (manpower, supplies, safe havens, etc)
but Jewish population was more organized, better outfitted for war (supplies, young men, military training)
82-3: Palestinians had no functioning government, much stronger regional ties than to government, difficulty in raising funds (many poor, few rich people didn't want to give (supported Jews, Christian, or just didn't want to)
84: Zionist movement created "embryo state" within Mandate to prepare for future self-government

skipping to Plan D

_____

116:By March/April, Arab world threatening Hagana/Jewish community, preparing to mobilize for end of GB Mandate on 15 May 1948
Hagana needed to defeat Palestinians before fighting Arab world
GB was moving out, wouldn't prevent Hagana from carrying out offensive
1 April: British troops had diminished to 28,000
Israel also went on offensive bc of new recruitment, reogranization, and shipment of supplies/weapons from Czechs

change in strategy for Hagana, now on offensive to crush Arab militia and ALA

118: 10 March 1948: Plan D dispatched to Hagana brigade commanders

Palestinian army, national community quickly collapsed (very weak against large unified attack, better at first style of small localized conflicts)

119: Plan D called for securement of territory outlined in UN partition for Jews, border areas next to Arab states, roads to urban centers, other territory

121: Operation Nahshon was first implementation of Plan D (April 4 1948), intended to open road to Jerusalem from Kibbutz Hulda via offensive
