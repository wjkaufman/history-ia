Given my former research from Ilan Pappe's book, I'm going to skim and find pertinent parts, then parhaps go back and read if I have more time

_____

63: UN Partition Resolution vote: 33 votes yes, 13 no, 10 abstentsions
65: 37% of population in Palestine (Jewish) got 55% of land in UN partition (and Jews only owned 7% at that point)
72_bottom: British mandate would end mid May 1948, Arabs planned to invade then to prevent implementation of UN partition
77: war called different things.  Arabs: First Palestine War, Palestinians: "the disaster," Jews: War of Independence/Establishment/Liberation
Civil War from 30 November 1947 (directly after UN Partition) to 14 May 1948 (right before GB Mandate ends)
Palestinians supported by volunteer groups from Arab world
2 parts to Civil War: Nov-March (Palestinians on offensive, Hagana on defense, no clear fronts), April - May (Hagana offensive (with Plan D), crushed Palestinians, created clear fronts)
Civil War took place while GB mandate was still there, but British offensive diminished as May approached (reason why Plan D happened at that point?*)
81: GB, people initially thought Palestinians would win civil war
	outmatched Jewish population 2:1 (1.2 million to 630,000 Jews)
	held more land, held highlands
	had sympathetic nations surrounding them (manpower, supplies, safe havens, etc)
but Jewish population was more organized, better outfitted for war (supplies, young men, military training)
82-3: Palestinians had no functioning government, much stronger regional ties than to government, difficulty in raising funds (many poor, few rich people didn't want to give (supported Jews, Christian, or just didn't want to)
84: Zionist movement created "embryo state" within Mandate to prepare for future self-government

Continuing research! (2014-12-30)

84: World Zionist Organization, fundraising in Jewish communities (US) helped buy arms
	Palestinians (theoretically) had whole Arab world, but less organized, less generous
85: Arab world “donated” volunteers, but still meager (poorly trained, divided)
85: Yishuv: large volunteer base as well, some idealists, some paid.  Lots of volunteer pilots and navigators, most from Allied powers in WWII
86: Yishuv had large militia (Hagana), 2 paramilitary/terrorist organizations (IZL, LHI)
Hagana renamed “Israeli Defense Forces” on 1 June 1948
87: 1946-7: Ben Gurion anticipated attack from surrounding Arab nations, called for improved military.  Arms plants made to produce guns, mortars, etc. (significant)
88-9: Palestine tried to form militia, had two paramilitary organizations, but both competed with each other and effectively cancelled each other out.  Palestine entered war with no military organization (whoops)
90: best organized military in Palestine: ALA (volunteers, set up by Arab league)
ALA: mostly made up of Syrians, Iraqis, came in to Palestine from Lebanon, Jordan
	crushed, ejected from Palestine by October 1948
91: Palestinian villages isolated, some aligned with Jews (hated neighbors, believed Jews would win).  Major supply problem for Palestinians, Arabs (most supplies ended up with ALA or armed bands, not villages).
92: arms for Arabs were also heterogeneous, many different calibers and some didn’t work.  Arab contingents loyal to different groups
5 February 1948: Arab meeting at Damascus under Syrian president.  Plan dividing Palestine into spheres of influence was made.  Larger problems (competing motives, rival militias) remained unresolved.

93: Civil War: 1st part of 1948 war.  Ended in destruction of Palestine (military, society)
	began 30 November 1947, ended on 14 May 1948
Palestinian Arab decay began way before, arguably during UNSCOP
local Palestinians knew they couldn’t fight Jews, but hoped for outside intervention (like in Crusader kingdoms)
94: Palestinian Christians wanted to leave, Muslims threatened to destroy property/kill
Palestinian flight began since November 1947, continued through March
likely most thought it would be a temporary displacement after Arab victories
only one town’s population was forcibly removed during this time (-March 1948): Qisariya in coastal plain in mid-February 1948
95: Jews harassed other towns, but Arabs also harassed Jewish towns  
Arab leadership: delayed response to population movement.  Began calling for stop in fleeing/exodus, but was inconsistent.
March: Arab leadership were more consistent in stopping exodus, forced men to stay and fight via propaganda, threats, etc.
96: Didn’t work: people didn’t listen, contrary orders from leadership (leadership was AHC or NC)
97: Economic changes also influenced exodus, hit Arab economy hard.
	Separated Arabs and Jews (prevented trade, working together)
	Jewish economy was more organized, fared better
	flee of Arab middle class increased unemployment, Arab econ. ran to standstill

98: Arab side: avoided mass attack/hostilities against Jews, ordered some local militias to desist
	waiting for G.B. to leave and/or outside Arab intervention
Haganah reacted defensively, only small retaliations against Arab violence
99: Haganah shifted from pure defense to "active defense" (response, punishment) on Dec 9

policy was to "hit the guilty", punished any who unnecessarily fought peace
100: big Jewish policy to avoid conflict, assigned "Arab affairs advisers" to know who was friendly and who wasn't.  This policy changed late March/April 1948 (much less friendly, more offensive)
	caveat: LHI, IZL (practically terror groups) didn't partake in discretion.  Several attacks on Arab communities, not necessarily instigated by Arabs
terrorist attacks from Jewish groups contributed to growth to full-scale war
101: Jewish leaders: if war starts, we will take as much as we can defend (thought to include Jewish settlements outside of UN territory at the time)
initially: Arabs instigated violence
lots more Arab casualties than Jewish casualties

skipping to Plan D

_____

116:By March/April, Arab world threatening Hagana/Jewish community, preparing to mobilize for end of GB Mandate on 15 May 1948
Hagana needed to defeat Palestinians before fighting Arab world
GB was moving out, wouldn't prevent Hagana from carrying out offensive
1 April: British troops had diminished to 28,000
Israel also went on offensive bc of new recruitment, reogranization, and shipment of supplies/weapons from Czechs

change in strategy for Hagana, now on offensive to crush Arab militia and ALA

118: 10 March 1948: Plan D dispatched to Hagana brigade commanders

Palestinian army, national community quickly collapsed (very weak against large unified attack, better at first style of small localized conflicts)

119: Plan D called for securement of territory outlined in UN partition for Jews, border areas next to Arab states, roads to urban centers, other territory

121: Operation Nahshon was first implementation of Plan D (April 4 1948), intended to open road to Jerusalem from Kibbutz Hulda via offensive
